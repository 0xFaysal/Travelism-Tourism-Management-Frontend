# Why I Built This Website

I developed this website as a platform to enhance my skills in MERN stack development. Through this project, I gained proficiency in:

- **React:** Used for building the frontend interface.
- **React Router:** Implemented for managing navigation within the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilized for designing a responsive and visually appealing UI.
- **MongoDB:** Integrated for storing and managing data related to tourist places.
- **Express.js:** Employed to create a robust backend server.
- **Node.js:** Used for server-side scripting and handling server operations.

**Key Achievements:**

- Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage tourist places effectively.
- Enhanced my understanding of full-stack development by integrating various technologies seamlessly.
- Created a platform where users can easily share and explore tourist spots based on their preferences.

Building this website not only allowed me to practice and consolidate my skills but also provided a practical application of the MERN stack technologies. I am excited to continue improving and expanding this project further.
